# 🚌 README.md — *The Mack Park Misadventure Machine™*

Welcome, brave traveller.  
If you’re reading this, you’ve clearly survived at least one (1) return trip to **Mack Park, Sydney** — a journey so character‑building it should count as a **TAFE qualification**.

This repo powers my little automation that helps distract me from the fact that:

- My commute is longer than some *regional flights*,  
- The traffic has its own mood swings,  
- And Mack Park seems to exist in a parallel universe where Google Maps says “17 mins” but somehow your soul knows it’s lying.

Consider this codebase my therapy project.  
Some people journal. Some meditate.  
I… write scripts that look for cheap flights because fantasising about leaving Sydney entirely is cheaper than a therapist.

## 🚗 Why This Exists

Every morning I crawl through Sydney traffic to get to Mack Park, wondering:

- Who designed this road layout?  
- Why are there *this many* roadworks at 7am?  
- Is this the day I finally snap and move to Queensland?  

So naturally, I automated *something completely unrelated* and used this README as an emotional outlet.

## ✈️ What This Repo Actually Does

- Scans NZ → AU flights  
- Finds Business / Premium Economy deals  
- Emails me “look, there’s a fare that’s cheaper than your Uber from Mack Park”  
- Gives me hope that one day I may escape the daily Mack Park M25 Simulator

## 🤦‍♂️ What This Repo Does *Not* Do

- Fix Sydney traffic  
- Teleport me to work  
- Make Mack Park any closer  
- File a noise complaint against the world’s loudest tradie ute

---

## 🧘‍♂️ The Coping Mechanisms (Features)

- **Lightweight Python scripts** — because Python never judges your life choices.  
- **Amadeus API integration** — actual real data, unlike Sydney traffic ETA predictions.  
- **Optional Brevo email notifications** — for when I need a hit of serotonin.  
- **Enough comments** to prove that yes, I *am* still sane. Mostly.

## 🧭 Future Enhancements

- Auto‑rebook my flights when traffic hits “Are you kidding me?” levels  
- Integrate with Google Maps to send condolences every morning  
- Add a panic button that instantly opens Seek.com.au

## 🥲 Final Thoughts

If you, too, commute to Mack Park:  
I see you.  
I feel your pain.  
And may this codebase bring you at least **one beautiful moment** of distraction from the never‑ending roadworks, roundabouts, and inexplicable delays.

Stay strong, commuter warrior.  
You’ve earned this README.
